Controllers
- The slot the controller works on is 4. 
- You can probably search for all the ports.

Code
- You can use #region to mark a certain area of code. 
This is helpful since you can't create multiple step events or whatever.
So instead, mark a region so you can minimize it when going through code.
This will make things so much neater!
- Use an enum for player states!
